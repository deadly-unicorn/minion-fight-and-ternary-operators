## League Of Legends minion fight.

### Story:
As I could see when writing this README file this webapp has an unused component named "Ternary".   
I can imagine I was learning about ternary operators when I created this. Perhaps I created this as a break-free and reward for all my efforts.  
There was a month I had stopped programming because I got my first job ever. (Not related to IT) (Apparently I didn't have enough time for life-ing, school, working AND programming. I eventually quit.).   
I am not sure when I initially wrote this webapp but I remember I showed it off to my classmates that didn't know how to write webapps yet and I felt so proud ;p.   
(Not just for the greater knoweledge possesion but also for showing them that they will also be able to do similar things if they tried hard enough, sometime).  
It's cool as I can use this app for a timestamp in my life. And also a sample to compare how much I have evolved my awful CSS and how what may soemthing that may look great at some point, may look awful to the same person in the future XD.   
(Tho I think that this "Game" was an impulsive thought I had and just made it in one night or less hehe.)

Things to note:  
+ The CSS breaking float numbers were intentional, and a reference to LoL's perfect non buggy Gaming experience. 
+ I am not sure if using URLs for the image elements was intentional, but I can guess it was.
+ 24-2-2023 I am adding the image files to the repository so that sometime in the future, the app doesn't look like a total dissapointment due to broken links. (Rip img2img, you lasted less than a year since I added you here)
+ I could update the source code, and replace the image URLs to local links, but to be honest looking at that React file routing, compared to what I've been used to for the past couple of months (Next.js), gives me  shivers.
+ The app apparently contains an example on Ternary Operators. :D
